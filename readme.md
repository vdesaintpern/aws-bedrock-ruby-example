# AI Model Invocation and Conversation Tests

This repository contains test scripts for invoking multi-modal Claude 3.5 model in Bedrock and conducting conversations. The scripts are written in Ruby and demonstrate various approaches to interacting with AI models.

## Contents

### Model Invocation 

- `test_invoke_model.rb`: Tests invoking an AI model using a specific API or library.
  - Demonstrates how to send a prompt to the model and process the response.
  - Includes error handling and basic result validation.

- `test-invoke_model.rb`: An alternative approach to model invocation.
  - Uses a different method or library for model interaction.
  - Showcases parameter tuning and response formatting.

### Conversation Tests

- `test_converse.rb`: Simulates a multi-turn conversation with an AI model.
  - Implements a basic conversation loop with user input and model responses.
  - Demonstrates how to maintain context across multiple exchanges.

- `test-conversation.rb`: Another example of conversation testing.
  - Uses a different conversation structure or API.
  - Includes features like conversation history management and topic tracking.

## Usage

To run the tests, make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. Then, you can execute each test script individually:
